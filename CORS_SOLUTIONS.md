# CORS Solutions for OfficeStonks

This document outlines several solutions to the persistent CORS issues between the frontend and backend.

## Solution 1: Use a CORS Proxy

We've implemented a CORS proxy solution that can be enabled with an environment variable:

```
REACT_APP_USE_CORS_PROXY=true
```

This solution works by routing API requests through a public CORS proxy service that adds the necessary CORS headers.

### Pros:
- Quick to implement
- No backend changes needed
- Can be enabled/disabled easily

### Cons:
- Relies on third-party services
- May have rate limits or reliability issues
- Adds latency to API requests
- Security concerns (requests go through third-party servers)

## Solution 2: Deploy a Custom CORS Proxy

We've created a simple Node.js proxy server (cors-proxy.js) that can be deployed separately:

```javascript
// See cors-proxy.js for implementation
```

### Pros:
- Full control over the proxy
- Can be deployed on Vercel or Railway
- More secure than public proxies

### Cons:
- Requires maintaining another service
- Adds complexity to the architecture
- Still introduces additional latency

## Solution 3: Fix the Backend CORS Configuration

We've attempted to fix the CORS configuration directly in the backend, but it seems Railway might be intercepting these requests.

### Better Backend Solutions:

1. **Ensure OPTIONS Requests Are Handled First**:
   ```go
   // Make sure this is registered BEFORE other middleware
   r.Use(corsMiddleware)
   ```

2. **Use a Dedicated CORS Library**:
   ```go
   import "github.com/rs/cors"
   
   c := cors.New(cors.Options{
     AllowedOrigins: []string{"https://officestonks-frontend.vercel.app"},
     AllowedMethods: []string{"GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE", "OPTIONS"},
     AllowedHeaders: []string{"Content-Type", "Authorization"},
     AllowCredentials: true,
   })
   
   handler := c.Handler(r)
   ```

3. **Configure Railway to Respect CORS Headers**:
   - Check Railway documentation for any proxy settings
   - Some PaaS providers allow configuring headers at the platform level

## Solution 4: Move to a Unified Deployment

Consider deploying both frontend and backend from the same domain to avoid CORS entirely:

### Options:
1. Serve the frontend from the Go backend (compile and serve as static files)
2. Move both services to the same domain with different paths
3. Use a reverse proxy like Nginx to serve both under the same domain

## Next Steps

1. Try the CORS proxy solution first (easiest, fastest)
2. If that works, deploy the custom proxy for better security
3. Continue troubleshooting the backend CORS configuration
4. Consider longer-term architectural changes if needed
